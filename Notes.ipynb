    "**What is Compression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compression is the process of reducing the size of data by encoding it more efficiently. In the context of video, compression is essential to reduce the file size of video files, making them easier to store and transmit over networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say, any raw video file when the recording just happened, it is in uncompressed format. Such files are huge in size for example, a 1-minute uncompressed 1080p video can take up several gigabytes of storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've `Storage` and `Bandwidth` limitations, we need to compress these video files to make them manageable. Compression helps in reducing the file size while maintaining an acceptable level of quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of video compression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lossless Compression**: In lossless compression, the original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. This type of compression is less common for video due to the high data rates involved, but it is used in scenarios where quality is paramount, such as medical imaging or archival footage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lossy Compression**: In lossy compression, some data is discarded to achieve higher compression ratios. This type of compression is more common for video, as it allows for significant reductions in file size while still maintaining acceptable visual quality. Examples of lossy compression algorithms include `H.264`, `H.265 (HEVC)`, and `VP9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Working of Video Compression**\n",
    "\n",
    "We know video is a sequence of images (frames) displayed in rapid succession to create the illusion of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if in a raw video, suppose there are 30 frames per second (fps), and let's say for at any point of time, for `1 Second` we might a `30 Frames` which are almost similar to each other with very minor changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can find a way to store only the differences between these frames rather than storing each frame in its entirety, we can significantly reduce the amount of data needed to represent the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this is the base concept of video compression, where we exploit the temporal redundancy between frames to reduce the overall data size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, there are other such areas where we can find `Redundancy` and `Exploit` them to achieve compression."
